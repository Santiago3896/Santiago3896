Hi, I'm Santiago Gini! 👋

Who I am? I am Santiago and I am 26 years old. Full Stack Developer with teamwork skills and good predisposition when working.

Throughout this year, I left my job to be able to give my life the turn I wanted. I quit my job and started studying Henry's bootcamp at Full Stack Developer, with more than 700 hours of theory and practice. I was able to do individual and group projects (with scrum methodology, dailys and demos every week) throughout the bootcamp, and I was able to learn the basics of both the back-end and the front-end with the JavaScript language.


My work experience? I worked approximately 3 years as an Account Executive recovering Iva from exporting companies and 3 years in a Forwarder in the administrative area.

Soft skills:
Problem solving, Self-taught, Dedicated, Sociable, Proactive, Responsible, Persevering.
